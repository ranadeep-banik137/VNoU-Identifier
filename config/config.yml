# App arguments
# face-recognition-model can have three values 1. mtcnn 2. cascade 3. VNoU
# mtcnn : It is slight faster and will capture accurate faces but has to be in proper position of camera
# cascade: it uses hog model which is very fast but lack in accuracy (uses haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml to detect face)
# VNoU: Very fast and 90% accurate assembled with various face conditions (A little tilted/frontal/left/right identification)
# Accuracy depends mainly on Camera & frame visibility
