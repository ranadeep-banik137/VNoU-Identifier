#App arguments
# face-recognition-model can have three values 1. mtcnn 2. cascade 3. inbuilt
# mtcnn : It is slight faster and will capture accurate faces but has to be in proper position of camera
# cascade: it uses hog model which is very fast but lack in accuracy (uses haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml to detect face)
# inbuilt: It used in-build face_recognition location identifiers which is pretty slow
# NOTE: If you choose 'inbuilt', make sure to populate 'face-location-identifier-model' under face_recognition.
# Values for 'face-location-identifier-model' would be 'cnn' & 'hog'
# "hog" is less accurate but faster on CPUs.
# "cnn" is a more accurate deep-learning model which is GPU/CUDA accelerated (if available). The default is "hog".
